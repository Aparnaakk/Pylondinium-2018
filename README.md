# Pylondinium-2018
Had an amazing time speaking and being a part of PyLondinium! Here are the slides to my talk titled 'Delve into Art and Creativity' and the code for everything mentioned can further be found on my github profile. 
Hopefully this inspires more people to explore the intersection of art and technology and creativity!
